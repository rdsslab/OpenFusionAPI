# FUNCTION Handler – Internal System Functions

The **FUNCTION handler** is designed to invoke pre-registered internal server functions. Unlike the JS handler which accepts raw code, this handler routes requests to specific named functions defined within the application environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This handler calls functions already created and registered on the server. It can only execute functions that are currently available.
> To find which functions are available in the current environment, you must use the MCP tools or call the system endpoint that returns the list of available functions.
> If you need to create a new function, it can only be done by the system administrator who has direct filesystem and access permissions to the server.

<summary>🧠 How It Works</summary>

When an endpoint is configured with the **FUNCTION** handler:

1.  **Lookup**: The system looks up the function name (defined in the `Code` or configuration) within the internal function registry (`fnLocal`).
    - It first checks the specific **App** environment.
    - If not found, it checks the **Public** scope.
2.  **Execution**: The function is executed with a standardized context object containing the request, response helpers, and server data.
3.  **Timeout**: Execution is protected by a **5-minute timeout** (AbortController).
4.  **Validation**: The output of the function is strictly validated against a predefined JSON schema (`schema_return_customFunction`) to ensure a consistent response structure.

**Handler Type**: `FUNCTION`

**Code Config**:
The "Code" field should contain the **name** of the registered function to call.

myCustomCalculationFn
```

<summary>💻 Implementation Interface</summary>

Functions registered to be used by this handler must act on a specific object signature:

```javascript
// Internal function signature
async function myCustomFunction({
	request, // Raw HTTP Request
	user_data, // Merged Query & Body
	reply, // Fastify Reply object
	server_data, // Internal Server Context
	signal // AbortSignal (for timeout handling)
}) {
	// Logic here...
	return {
		code: 200,
		data: { result: 'success' }
	};
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📥 Response Format</summary>

The function **must** return an object matching this structure to pass validation:

```json
{
  "code": 200,   // HTTP Status Code
  "data": ...    // The actual response payload (Object, Array, String)
}
```

If the return value does not match the schema, the handler returns HTTP `500` with validation errors.
