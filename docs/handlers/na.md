# NA Handler – Internal Default / No-op

The **NA** handler is an internal placeholder used by OpenFusionAPI when an endpoint has no effective handler assigned.

<details>
<summary>🧠 Purpose</summary>

- Preserve backward compatibility with legacy records.
- Represent "not configured yet" states safely.
- Avoid accidental execution of incomplete endpoints.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Behavior</summary>

- It is **not intended** for business logic.
- It should be treated as a **no-op / invalid runtime target**.
- Requests to endpoints configured with `NA` are expected to fail fast until a real handler is selected.

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Recommended Usage</summary>

- Use only as a transitional/default value in metadata.
- Migrate endpoints from `NA` to a concrete handler (`JS`, `FUNCTION`, `FETCH`, `SQL`, etc.) before exposing them.

<details>
<summary>🚫 Do Not Use For</summary>

- Production endpoint execution.
- Integrations that require deterministic responses.
- Public MCP tools.
